At startup check for the existance of the supervisor database.

Checking of the dashboard databases is done by the collection process


- if database does not exist, create from clean-supervisor.sql.  The installer will create that during installation
but it may have been deleted for some reason.

- if the database exists, run the alterdb script in case of any recent changes, for instance from a new update or changes
during development.

- read the current hosts from the supervisor database and add them to the collector at startup
